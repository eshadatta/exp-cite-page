I’m pleased to share the 2022 board election slate. Crossref’s Nominating Committee received 40 submissions from members worldwide to fill five open board seats.

We maintain a balance of eight large member seats and eight small member seats. A member’s size is determined based on the membership fee tier they pay. We look at how our total revenue is generated across the membership tiers and split it down the middle. Like last year, about half of our revenue came from members in the tiers $0 - $1,650, and the other half came from members in tiers $3,900 - $50,000. We have four large member seats and one small member seat open for election in 2022.

The [Nominating Committee](/committees/nominating) presents the following slate.


## The 2022 slate

### Tier 1 candidates (electing one seat):
* **eLife**, Damian Pattinson, Executive Director
* **Pan Africa Science Journal**, Oscar Donde, Editor in Chief

### Tier 2 candidates (electing four seats):
* **Clarivate**, Christine Stohn, Director of Product Management
* **Elsevier**, Rose L’Huillier, Senior Vice President Researcher Products
